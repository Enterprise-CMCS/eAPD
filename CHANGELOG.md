# Next release

Anticipated release: TBD

#### 🚀 New features

- Attempt to alert users before automatically logging them out due to inactivity. The app will try to use built-in browser notifications as well as flashing the tab title. In browsers that support it, the app treats activity in any eAPD tab as valid, so all eAPD tabs will remain valid as long as at least one of them is getting activity. (#1666)

#### 🐛 Bugs fixed

- Prompt for confirmation before deleting APD key personnel (#1651, #1647)
- Fixed accessibility issues on the login page and the dashboard (#1688)
- Fixed semantic heading levels (#1695)

#### ⚙️ Behind the scenes

- Remove unused code
- Updated 3rd-party dependencies
