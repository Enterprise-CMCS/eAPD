Add any deliverables like a mockup, or a link to a prototype, a link to a Figma

exist.

Add in screenshots or annotated screenshots that show context of the request
within the app, or show before and after if appropriate, however it helps to
illustrate a concept or request

If needed, a note about priority (future enhancement tag, before initial
release, etc)

### This task is done when…

- [ ] any acceptance criteria (not process oriented, requirements of feature)
- [ ] designs are created, taking into consideration validation, multiple FFY,
      multiple entries, long entries, weird entries, and/or the export view if
      applicable
- [ ] 508 visual, content, and UX considerations and/or recommendations are
      reviewed
- [ ] designs are shared
- [ ] designs are approved by product
- [ ] if there is a long discussion, a summary of changes for dev will be added
      to the last comment before transfer

Add additional labels (design, dev, compliance, BUG, etc) and size before
submitting.

If the issue is needed to complete prioritized work for the CURRENT SPRINT, add
it to the "This Sprint" pipeline. Otherwise, all other issues will be
automatically added to the _unprioritized pipeline_ for prioritization in
backlog refinement or sprint planning with Product.
