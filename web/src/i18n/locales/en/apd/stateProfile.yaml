  title: Key Personnel & Project Management Planning
  helpText: >-
    Identify key state staff who will be involved in all activities listed in
    this APD.  Personnel listed in this section must be assigned to APD by name, role,
    time commitment, and cost, where applicable.
  reminder: >-
    Key personnel are individuals involved with all activities within this
    APD, or are involved with governance, coordination, stakeholder
    decision-making, oversight, and/or project performance. Individuals whose responsibilities
    apply only to specific activities should be listed individually under Program
    Activities instead. CMS seeks to ensure  state teams are adequately resourced,
    but does not require states to provide key vendor personnel to satisfy this
    requirement.
