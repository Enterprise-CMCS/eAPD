  Describe how this activity will support the Medicaid standards
  and conditions.
modularity:
  header: Modularity
  subheader: >-
    Modularity requires the use of a modular, flexible approach
    to systems development, including the use of open interfaces
    and exposed application programming interfaces (API); the
    separation of business rules from core programming; and the
    availability of business rules in both human and machine-readable
    formats.  
    Commitment to formal system development methodology
    and open reusable system architecture is extremely important in
    order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain
    systems. Integration and interoperability with a clinical and
    administrative ecosystem, is designed to deliver person-centric services
    and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into
    component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as
    part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA).  
    Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization. 
    Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used
    by anyone, with exceptions for specific business processes handled
    by a separate module that interoperates with the baseline modules.    

    Changes can be made independently to baseline
    capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing
    so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be
    deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element
    of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an
    understanding where services and code will be integrated, and where
    the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy.

mita:
  header: Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA)
  subheader: >-
    This condition requires states to advance and align increasingly
    in MITA maturity for business, architecture, and data. CMS expects
    states to complete and make measurable progress in implementing their
    MITA roadmaps. CMS strives to accelerate the modernization of Medicaid
    enterprise that been achieved.

industryStandards:
  header: Industry Standards
  subheader: >-
    States must ensure alignment with, and incorporation of, industry
    standards: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security, privacy and transaction standards;
    accessibility standards established under section 508 of the
    Rehabilitation Act, or standards that provide greater accessibility
    for individuals with disabilities, and compliance with federal
    civil rights laws; standards adopted by the Secretary under section
    1104 of the Affordable Care Act; and standards and protocols
    adopted by the Secretary under section 1561 of the Affordable
    Care Act.  
    CMS must ensure that Medicaid infrastructure and
    information system investments are made with the assurance that
    timely and reliable adoption of industry standards and productive
    use of those standards are part of the investments. Industry
    standards promote reuse, data exchange, and reduction of
    administrative burden on patients, providers, and applicants.

    Standards condition
leverage:
  header: Leverage
  subheader: >-
    State solutions should promote sharing among, leverage, and reuse of
    Medicaid technologies and systems among states. States
    can benefit substantially from the experience and investments
    of other states through the reuse of components and technologies
    already developed, consistent with a service-oriented architecture,
    from publicly available or commercially sold components and
    products, and from the use of cloud technologies to share
    infrastructure and applications.  
    CMS commits to work assertively with the states to identify promising
    state systems  that can be leveraged by other states. CMS strongly
    encourages states to move to regional or multi-state solutions
    when cost effective. In addition, CMS will expedite APD approvals for states
    that are participating in shared development activities (including
    developing components intended for successful reuse) with other states.
    CMS will also review carefully any proposed investments in sub-state systems 
    when the federal government is asked to share costs of updating or
    maintaining multiple systems performing redundant functions within the same state.

businessResults:
  header: Business Results
  subheader: >-
    Systems should support accurate and timely processing of claims
    (including claims of eligibility), adjudications, and effective
    communications with providers, beneficiaries, and the public.  
    An effective system supports and enables an effective business process, 
    producing and communicating intended operational results with
    reliability and accuracy. Federal funding are not provided for systems
    unable to support desired business outcomes.

    condition
reporting:
  header: Reporting
  subheader: >-
    Systems should be able to produce and to expose
     electronically the accurate data that are necessary for oversight,
     administration, evaluation, integrity, and transparency. These
     systems should produce reports that contribute to continuous
     improvement in business operations, transparency, and accountability.
     
     Reports should be automatically generated through open interfaces
     to designated federal repositories or data hubs, with appropriate
     audit trails. MITA 3.0 will provide additional detail about
     reporting requirements arising from the Affordable
     Care Act. Additional details about data definitions, specifications,
     timing, and routing of information will be supplied at a later date.
  title: Describe how this activity will support the Reporting condition
interoperability:
  header: Interoperability
  subheader: >-
    Systems must ensure seamless coordination and integration with the
    state or federal exchanges, and
    allow interoperability with HIE, public
    health agencies, human services programs, and community
    organizations providing outreach and enrollment assistance
    services. CMS expects a key outcome government
    technology investments will be improved interaction
    and interoperability to maximize value and minimize costs
    on providers, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders.  
    CMS expects Medicaid agencies to work in concert with
    exchanges (whether state or federally administered) to share
    business services and technology investments to produce
    seamless and efficient customer experiences.  

    Systems must include appropriate architecture, and standardized
    communication protocols to preserve the
    ability to appropriately exchange
    data with other participants in the health and human services
    enterprise. According to MITA Framework 2.0, each state is
    “responsible for knowing and understanding its environment
    (data, applications and infrastructure) in order to map its data
    to information sharing requirements."

    The data-sharing architecture addresses conceptual and 
    logical mechanisms used (i.e., data hubs, repositories, and registries). 
    It also addresses data semantics, data harmonization strategies, 
    shared-data ownership, security and privacy implications and
    quality of shared data.

mitigationStrategy:
  header: Mitigation Strategy
  subheader: >-
    Condition § 433.112(b)(18) requires states
    submit mitigation plans addressing strategies to reduce the
    consequences of failure for all major milestones and functionality.
    Maintaining a mitigation plan is an industry standard best practice
    for any major IT build; CMS expects that states will identify
    potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks
    throughout the system lifecycle.  
    Mitigation plans for major
    Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum
    expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors
    tied to major milestones identified in the APD.  
    Mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger
    mitigation, and projected timeframe for sunset.
    States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O project
    phase, such as staffing issues and software upgrades. CMS expects states
    to revise and resubmit their plans to CMS as risks and mitigations
    change along the system lifecycle. States’ proposed mitigations should
    be commensurate with nature and scope of identified risks.  

    CMS also expects states will submit mitigation plans with the APDs to
    demonstrate compliance with this condition.

    Strategy condition
keyPersonnel:
  header: Key Personnel
  subheader: >-
    The condition described at § 433.112(b)(19) requires that states
    identify their key state personnel assigned to each major project
    by name, role, and time commitment. Before we approve a state to
    launch a major IT initiative, CMS wants to ensure that the state
    team is adequately resourced. States do not need to provide key
    vendor personnel for this requirement.
    As stated in the
    provision, this information must be included in the APD. 
    For changes to key personnel that occur after an APD is approved,
    states should notify their CMS points of contact in writing
    (including by email) and formally reflect the change in the next
    planned APD update.  
    This condition refines and strengthens the existing APD
    requirements regarding personnel resource statements as required
    under 45 CFR 95.610. For Medicaid E&E APDs, states should include
    this information in the “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment (EE)
    Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) Template” (OMB
    Approval Number: 0938-1268). Although there is currently no APD
    template for MMIS APDs, states must include this information in
    all MMIS APDs for major IT initiatives.

documentation:
  header: Documentation
  subheader: >-
    The condition described at § 433.112(b)(20) requires that states
    maintain documentation for certain software such that the software
    could be operated by contractors and other users. This condition is
    limited to software that is developed using federal funds; it does
    not apply to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software,
    software-as-a-service, or business-solutions-as-a-service.  
    Adequate documentation means other users could operate software
    with reasonable alterations for specific hardware or operating
    system. CMS is neutral with regrard to hardware or operating
    system. Documentation must follow industry
    standards and include components,
    procedures, layouts, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and other
    necessary information to ensure systems could be installed and
    operated by a variety of contractors or other users.  
    While the APD should address how the state plans to maintain documentation,
    documentation is not required with the APD.
    States are responsible for making documentation
    available upon request and to upload documentation to CALT or
    successor systems as needed for gate reviews or reuse.
    Submission to other repositories may be required as CMS explores
    other options.

minimizeCost:
  header: >-
    Strategies to Minimize Cost and Difficulty on Alternative
    Hardware or Operating System
  subheader: >-
    The condition described at § 433.112(b)(21) requires that states
    consider strategies to minimize the costs and difficulty of
    operating the software on alternate hardware or operating
    systems. This condition recognizes the significant federal and
    state investments that are involved with major Medicaid IT projects
    and requires that states consider options beyond software that
    will reduce costs or promote reuse.    
    States should describe strategies considered when 
    deciding which most efficient solution. States are not required to
    adopt a particular strategy, but CMS must have sufficient
    description to evaluate extent the state conisdered
    other solutions. States should consider, at a minimum, the options
    that offer more opportunities for reuse, lower development costs,
    lower long-term operating costs, and shorter development time as
    well as the extent to which the solutions can be readily implemented
    with alternate hardware and operating systems.  
    States should consider this new condition in conjunction with existing APD
    requirements regarding cost benefit analyses required at 45 CFR
    95.605 or § 95.610.
