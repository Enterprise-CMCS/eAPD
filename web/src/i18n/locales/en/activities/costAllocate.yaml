      Cost allocation plan must include all participants and their associated
      costs to depict non-Medicaid activities.


      [ol] CMS will work with states individually to determine the most
      appropriate cost allocation methodology.

      HITECH cost allocation formulas should be based on direct benefit to
      Medicaid EHR incentive program, accounting for state projections of
      eligible Medicaid provider participation.

      Cost allocation must account for other available federal funding sources
      including division of resources and activities across relevant payers, and
      relative benefit to the state Medicaid program.

      Cost allocations should be current and ensure financial participation of
      all parties so Medicaid funds are neither the sole contributor at the
      onset, nor the primary source of funding. Other payers who may benefit
      must contribute their share from the outset. The absence of ancillary
      payers is not sufficient cause for Medicaid to be the primary payer. [/ol]

        **Example:** This is a beneficiary based cost allocation. A sample was
        collected between January 1, 2023 through July 1, 2023 to determine the
        beneficiary count and percentages. This was approved by the Division of
        Cost Allocation Services as part of the State's PACAP on 1/1/2023.  
          
        **Example:** This is a utilization based cost allocation: The system
        reports the number of Medicaid queries made to the system. A report is
        generated every quarter by the vendor to determine specific Medicaid
        related costs.

      For each quarter, enter the percentage of the total Medicaid FFP cost that
      will be spent in each category. The auto-calculated dollar values for each
      quarter should align with the state's quarterly FFP estimates for CMS. As
      a reminder, In-house costs equals state staff + other state expenses.

      Input a higher percentage in quarters where there may be non-reoccurring
      costs and adjust the other quarters downward to ensure the totals do not
      exceed 100%. Examples of non-reoccurring costs may include a one-time
      state equipment purchases (in-house costs) or payments on a contract
      deliverable (private contractor costs). An example of a reoccurring cost
      may include a salaried positions where the cost is equally divided into
      each quarter.
